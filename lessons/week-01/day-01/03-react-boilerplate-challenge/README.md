# React Boilerplate

## User Story

> As a software engineer I want to create a new React application using the `create-react-app` script

## Acceptance Criteria

> Must use the `create-react-app` script to create the react project boilerplate code

> Must name the project `my-first-react-app`

> Must push all code to GitHub as a new repository

## Getting Started

> Navigate to your `coding_bootcamp` workspace:

```
cd ~/coding_bootcamp
```

> Create a react project using the `create-react-app` script:

```
npx create-react-app my-first-react-app
cd my-first-react-app
```

> Create a repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and enter the "Repository name" as the same name as your react app `my-first-react-app`.

> In the terminal within your react app enter the commands provided by GitHub. The first command points your local repository to the remote GitHub, the second command sets your branch as `main` and the last command pushes all your local changes to the remote repository

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/my-first-react-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

> Once you refresh your GitHub page on the web browser you will see all your local files in GitHub.

> You can now proceed to work locally and add commit and push code regularly during development
